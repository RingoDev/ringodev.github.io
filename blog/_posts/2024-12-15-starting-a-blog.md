title: "I am starting a Blog"

## Welcome

Hey, my name is Thomas, and I am a Security Engineer and Product Owner @ [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/){:
target="_blank"}.
This is the start of my blog.
I can't guarantee regular postings, but I would like to have a place where I can summarise and share some thoughts I
have about products and security engineering.

The design is heavily inspired by [Seth Michael Larson's blog](https://sethmlarson.dev/){:target="_blank"} who gave me the final push to finally kick off my own blog.
Knowing myself, the design will heavily fluctuate over the next months until I settle for something. I would like to
keep it minimal though.

I am building this site with [Jekyll and serving it with GitHub-Pages](https://github.com/RingoDev/ringodev.github.io){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to check it out!
